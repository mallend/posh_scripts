## This will return all users in the specified OU and change their SamAccountName field to the new format
## As long as their email is accurate
## Uncomment the first $searchbase to run script against the OU specified

#$searchbase = "/path/to/OU"

$users = Get-ADUser -Filter 'Name -like "*"' -SearchBase $searchbase -Properties * #| Select-Object SamAccountName,UserPrincipalName,EmailAddress

foreach($user in $users){
$currentsam = $user.SamAccountName
$upn = $user.UserPrincipalName
$ptc = $null

if ($user.EmailAddress -match ".opt1@") { $tmp = "OPT1" }
if ($user.EmailAddress -match ".opt2@") { $tmp = "OPT3" }
if ($user.EmailAddress -match ".opt3@") { $tmp = "OPT2" }

$tempsam = $upn.Trim("@domain")
$newsam = $tempsam + "." + $tmp

Get-ADUser -Identity $user.SamAccountName | Set-ADUser -SamAccountName $newsam
}

## i.e. if user's current SamAccountName is first.m.last, it needs to be changed to ID.tmp,
## So john.l.smith would be changed to 1234.OPT1 as long as his email correctly identifies him as opt1
